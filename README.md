In this study, 249 mice were identified with SCC tumors. A total of 10 drug treatment regimens were used to reduce the tumor volume of the mice. Each mouse received treatment with one drug regimen over a 45 day time frame.

Of the 10 treatment regimens, Capomulin and Ramicane had the lowest mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error statistics. They also had similar results for each of the measurements; Capomulin showed a mean tumor volume of 40.675741 (mm3) and Ramicane had a mean of 40.216745.

A bar chart showed that Capomulin and Ramicane had the highest number of Observed Mouse Timepoints, making their data more reliable than the other treatment regimen data.

A pie chart showed that the mice were evenly distributed among sex with 51% Male and 49% Female.

Only 1 potential outlier was found among the treatments: Infubinol, tumor volume: 36.21. This outlier was close to the mean of Capomulin and Ramicane and seemed to be the only mouse that was effectively treated with Infubinol.

Capomulinâ€™s data was broken down for one mouse and showed an initial increase in tumor volume from 0-20 days, and then a sharp decrease from 20-35 days of treatment. After 35 days of treatment the tumor volume of Mouse 1509 started increasing.

A scatter plot and linear regression showed that there is a positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin. The correlation coefficient=0.84, indicating a strong correlation. Because of this correlation, a preventative measure for tumors might include weight management.

Overall, Capomulin was effective at reducing tumor volume up until 35 days. After that the volume started increasing. More research will have to be done to see if the tumor volume continues to increase after 45 days.
